lwip-contrib
============

fork of the lwip-contrib repository


a fork of the contrib repository of the light-weight IP stack, originally created by Adam Dunkels.
LwIP is maintained at [savannah](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/) and more info is available in the [wiki](http://lwip.wikia.com/wiki/LwIP_Wiki)

I created this fork ([and the lwip source itself](https://github.com/tabascoeye/lwip)) to see if GitHub and its [powerful integrations](https://github.com/integrations) like [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org) could help LwIP to speed up the release cycle a bit.

**Consider this repository as an experiment for now!**

See the [original REAMDE file](https://github.com/tabascoeye/lwip-fork/blob/master/README) for more info.
